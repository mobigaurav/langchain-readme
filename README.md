# Fooddelivery-clone

Project Overview:

"Fooddelivery-clone" is a JavaScript-based project that aims to clone the functionality of an existing food delivery application. The repository contains numerous components, predominantly written in JavaScript, which together build up the core functionality of the application.

The main components include:

- BasketIcon.js : Handles the basket icon functionality.
- Categories.js and CategoryCard.js: These components deal with the categorization of food items.
- DishRow.js and FeaturedRow.js: List out the dishes and featured dishes respectively.
- RestaurantCard.js: Displays restaurant details.
- basketSlice.js and restaurantSlice.js: These are Redux slices for managing state related to the basket and restaurant respectively.
- Screens: Includes various screens like BasketScreen.js, DeliveryScreen.js, Home.js, PreparingOrderScreen.js, and RestaurantScreen.js which together build up the user interface of the application.

Other files like .gitignore, README.MD, yarn.lock, and several asset files contribute to the project setup, documentation, and UI visuals respectively. JSON files like app.json and package.json are used for project setup and managing dependencies.

Please refer to individual file and component for more specific details.

## Features

- 1. The project is built using JavaScript, specifically using React Native framework for building mobile applications.

- 2. The project uses Redux for state management, as inferred from the 'store.js' file and 'features' directory, containing files like 'basketSlice.js' and 'restaurantSlice.js'.

- 3. The application employs several reusable components such as 'BasketIcon.js', 'Categories.js', 'CategoryCard.js', 'DishRow.js', 'FeaturedRow.js', and 'RestaurantCard.js' to build the UI, which indicates a modular design.

- 4. There are specific screens for various functionalities of the app including 'BasketScreen.js', 'DeliveryScreen.js', 'Home.js', 'PreparingOrderScreen.js', and 'RestaurantScreen.js'.

- 5. The 'tailwind.config.js' file suggests that the project utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- 6. The 'App.js' is the main entry point of the application.

- 7. The project includes asset files like adaptive icons, delivery animation gif, favicon, and splash screen for visual input in the application.

- 8. 'babel.config.js' file indicates the use of Babel, a JavaScript compiler that converts edge JavaScript into backwards compatible version.

- 9. The 'package.json' file is present, which contains metadata about the app like its dependencies.

- 10. The project uses 'yarn.lock' file, indicating that Yarn is used as a package manager.

- 11. It has a '.gitignore' file to ignore unneeded files and folders in the git repository.

- 12. The project includes a 'README.MD' file for documentation about the project.


## Code Overview

['Project "Fooddelivery-clone" is a food delivery application developed in JavaScript language, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language conforming to the ECMAScript specification. The main files and components of the project are found in the JavaScript and JSON formats, along with several assets and configuration files.', '', "The main application logic is housed in the 'App.js' file. Supplementary configuration for Babel, a JavaScript compiler, is found in the 'babel.config.js' file. The application's state management is handled by 'store.js', while Tailwind CSS configuration is found in 'tailwind.config.js'.", '', "Several components form the building blocks of the application's UI. 'BasketIcon.js' is responsible for the basket icon functionality, 'Categories.js' and 'CategoryCard.js' manage the display of food categories, 'DishRow.js' handles the display of individual dishes, 'FeaturedRow.js' manages the featured dishes row, and 'RestaurantCard.js' is used for displaying restaurant data.", '', "The application also includes Redux slices (features) for basket and restaurant functionalities, found in the 'basketSlice.js' and 'restaurantSlice.js' files respectively.", '', "The screens directory contains files for different screens of the application: 'BasketScreen.js' (Basket Screen), 'DeliveryScreen.js' (Delivery Screen), 'Home.js' (Home Screen), 'PreparingOrderScreen.js' (Preparing Order Screen), and 'RestaurantScreen.js' (Restaurant Screen).", '', "The JSON files in the project include 'app.json' and 'package.json'. The 'app.json' file is used for setting up application configurations, while 'package.json' manages the projectâ€™s dependencies.", '', "The assets folder contains several image files and GIFs used throughout the application. Also, there are files such as '.gitignore' (specifying untracked files that Git should ignore), 'README.MD' (containing information about the project), and 'yarn.lock' (automatically generated for any operations where Yarn modifies either the node_modules directory or the 'package.json' file).", '', 'The project follows a structured approach to creating a fully functional food delivery application, using modern JavaScript and its associated libraries and frameworks.']
