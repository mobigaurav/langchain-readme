# Technical Documentation for cse571-ai

## Code Overview

["The cse571-ai project is a comprehensive project focused on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of collision prediction. The project is implemented using Python language, as evident from the Python files found in the repository. The project appears to split into two major parts - 'assignment_part1' and 'assignment_part2'. ", '', "The first part, 'assignment_part1', includes Python scripts such as Helper.py, SimulationEnvironment.py, SteeringBehaviors.py, and collect_data.py. These scripts suggest that the initial part of the project involves setting up a simulation environment and gathering necessary data for further analysis and model training. The __pycache__ folder contains the compiled Python files, which are used for faster loading of the scripts. ", '', "The 'assets' folder within 'assignment_part1' holds two images of robots, possibly used in the simulation environment. A 'saved' folder contains a CSV file that likely holds the collected training data.", '', "The second part, 'assignment_part2', includes a Python script named Data_Loaders.py, which probably is used for loading and preprocessing the data gathered in the first part of the project. The 'saved' folder within 'assignment_part2' contains a CSV file for training data and a Pickle (.pkl) file for the scaler object, suggesting that some form of data scaling is performed on the training data. There is also a 'saved_old' folder that contains older versions of these files.", '', "There are also some Markdown files ('README.md', 'readme.md') present in the project, providing essential documentation and instructions about the project. ", '', "A PDF document titled 'CSE-571_Neural-Network-for-Collision-Prediction_Overview-Document.pdf' is found in the 'Unknown' category. It likely provides a detailed overview or report of the project.", '', "Moreover, a .csv file named 'submission.csv' in the 'assignment_part1' folder suggests that the outcome of the project (predictions or results) might be stored in this file.", '', 'Overall, the cse571-ai project appears to be a well-structured project involving simulation, data collection, preprocessing, and possibly model training and prediction in the domain of collision prediction using artificial intelligence techniques.']
